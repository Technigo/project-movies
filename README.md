# Project Movies
This is a pair-programming-project done by Jenny Quach and Birgit Nehrwein.
In this week's project we focused on how to make React apps with multiple pages using routes. In this app, we've used an API to fetch popular and upcoming movies in the US.

##Learning objectives
How to use React router to create multi-page applications
How to use placeholders in urls to pick dynamic parts from urls
Practice using APIs in React - combining useState with useEffect
## The problem

We started by fetching all the data from the API that we wanted to use in our page. In the same time we created different components for the different pages. Once we finished that we started to build multi-page applications using React Router. When we finished the general requirements, we added more pages and components to our page. We also added some features to get our app to be more user friendly. If we had more time, we would add more energy to find out how to not duplicate the codes for the different pages.
