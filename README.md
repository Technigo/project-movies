# Project Movies

A dynamic multipage movie application listing top 20 popular movies in the US, built in React using React Router.

## The problem

After sketching the components on paper, and planning on what to include in which, I started building them in React. Once the components and some test content was there I fetched data from themoviedb.org's API. Styling happened last and was inspired by Netflix. 

If I would have had more time: error handling for all movie API endpoints (what happens if there is no backdrop img for example), back to movies link on movie details page and a similar movies page (endpoint included in the API).
