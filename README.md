# Project Movies

This weeks project was all about building multi-page applications using React Router. It was done through pair-programming by Matilda Frid and Johanna Leonsson. The task was to create a site where the user can scroll through the latest movie releases and select a movie to read more about. 

## The problem

We started out planning and creating the components we wanted to use. Then we made sure that we could fetch the correct data from the IMDB API and insert it into our components. Once we got all the basic functions to work, we continued with styling the different pages according to the styling proposal we had recieved before.
