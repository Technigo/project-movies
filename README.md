# Project Movies

This is a multi-page React app that uses the Movie database API to display upcoming movies and details about them.One of my projects during Technigo frontend boot camp.

## What did I do?

I was given a design to replicate as closely as possible. In this project I started with doing some sketches of the pages and components I would use to recreate the design.

I spent some time looking through the API documentation and how to fetch and use the data.

In this project I used hooks, React router, CSS and HTML. I used flexbox and grid for layout.

The original design wasn't responsive, but my version is. However, there are still things to improve, such as loading smaller images for mobiles.
