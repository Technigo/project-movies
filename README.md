# Project Movies 

A movie website built with React.js and using the router to navigate to different pages 🎬💥👩‍💻✨

## Code
I've used:
  * **API**
  * **React.js**
  * **JSX**
  * **JavaScript**
  * **CSS**

## The problem

Approached the project by splitting up the homepage from the detailed info to make sure that the basics worked. Did the same type of map-function I've used in the passed and was able to retrive all info I wanted. Later on did a dropdown that will sort the list of movies depending on the chosen category, popular by default. 
Continued with the details for each movie and styling the site to make it responsive and easy to use. Added some animation on the back button and a darken gradient for the background.
