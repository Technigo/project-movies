# Project Movies

Replace this readme with your own information about your project.

Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.

We were asked to create a page listing movies according to an API and when clicking a movie, to be redirected to a page with further details. The details page required a new fetch.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

We began by following the outline of this weeks documentation which clearly showed how to solve the problem. We had som struggles with paths and params, but through trial-and-error we solved them. The largest issue was almost styling and we learned a lor here (for example setting background image in a div using inline style to be able to use a path in the src). If we had more time we would have liked to have tried to make a "next" button the details page which would bring you to the next movie in the MovieList.

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
