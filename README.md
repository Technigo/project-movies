# Project Movies 

The assignment was to build a multi-page React application, using an API that fetches popular movies in the US.


## The problem

We looked at the provided videos from technigo for this weeks project, googled, searched on Stack Overflow. We also got help from joining the live sessions. 

If we had more time we would like to add more pages, add a dropdown menu, add a page to catch errors from the API.
