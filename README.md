# Project Movies

Here's an app with multiple pages where I listed trending movies using API information fetched from the https://www.themoviedb.org/. 
The site shows a series of posters on different film and when you click on one you get to another side where you can read about the movie and see the ratings. 

Design provided by Technigo - https://technigo-movies-project.netlify.app/

Built using React Router. 

## The problem / Approach

I started the project sketching the final page and then breaked it up in smaller pieces. 
Decided how many components and the pieces of information that goes in them. 

With this approach I felt like I had something to look back on when I felt lost and/or overwhelmed and made the path a little easier and clearer.
