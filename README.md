# Project Movies

Team Josefine Engdahl, Cecilia Fr√•nlund, Petra Eriksson.

In this project we were building a multi-page application using React Router.
It's passing information in the URL and pick this up in React router to load dynamic content. 
Were also using APIs in React - combining `useState` with `useEffect`.

## The problem

We made a plan of how to approach the problem in figma. Started out fetching the data, and passed props components. Added some React Routes to Components and finally styled the CSS. If we had more time we would add more information about each movie.
