# Project Movies üçø

This project is a movie app created in React using routes, useEffect and useState hooked on an external API and, of course, some styling was added via CSS.

Tech stack and features
- React Hooks
- React Router
- JSX
- CSS


## The problem

We constructed an umbrella components App.js where we added the routes and fetched the API. We further added two key components - List.js and IndividualMovie.js. On the IndividualMovie.js we additionally called on the api. We have also added NotFound.js and LoadingPage.js in order to improve the user experience. The page was further styled in CSS that is fully responsive.
