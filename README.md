# Project Movies

This site is about popular movies in the US.

## The problem

In this project I used HTML, CSS, JS, React, API, BEM and NPM. This is my first site with multi-page React. I used npm to instal some libraries that were needed for my project like loader and fontawesome. When I had problem I used google and stackoverflow. If I had more time I would done black level :)



## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
