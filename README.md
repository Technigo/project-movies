# Project Movies
Week 12 at Technigo Bootcamp
– By using themoviedb.org's API I fetched a list of movies, displayed them on a page and then linked to a movie detail page when you click on the movie.
– I learned how to build multi-page applications using React Router.
– I learned how to pass information such as product ids, or blog post titles in the url and pick this up in React router to load dynamic content.

## The problem

I solved this weeks project by fetching data in the pages that should show data and kept the App.js clean and easy to read.
