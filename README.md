# Project Movies

We created a movie site with multiple pages using React router and two API endpoints. We styled the page to look like the design given.


## The problem

We began by completing the Example Project separately and then we used the knowledge from that to start the project together. We added all the components and fetched the APIs together while doing a live share on VS Code, and then created separate branches to style the movie list page and the movie details page individually. Fanny finished first so she also created the loading page and styled the header. If we had more time, we would add more pages and fetch more information from another API endpoint.
