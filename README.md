# Project Movies ðŸŽ¬

This project is a React app with three pages - one showing a list of movies, one showing details about single movies and one showing a 'not-found-page'. I use the themoviedb.org's API to fetch movies and details data for the movies.

My project meets the requirements of having at least two pages and following the provided design. As an added feature I also have a re-directed 'not found' page if a user enters an invalid movie ID. From this page the user can go back (via Link form react-router-dom) to the movies list page. 

For this project I have learnt and practiced:

- How to use React router to create multi-page applications
- How to use placeholders in urls to pick dynamic parts from urls
- How to use APIs in React - combining `useState`, `useEffect` with `useParams`

I have also learnt about Route and how to use Link to connect pages together. I created a PopularList component with Route. This route is responsible for the home page. It usesÂ `useEffect`Â to run an API request to themoviedb.org and fetch popular films in the US, puts them into state usingÂ `useState`, and then renders them wrapped in aÂ `Link`Â fromÂ `react-router-dom`Â to link to the detail page.

The second component MoviesDetails has a route that expects a movie ID in the URL and is responsible for showing more details about a movie after you click on it. It usesÂ `useParams`Â fromÂ `react-router-dom`Â to get theÂ `id`Â from the URL and then passes that into an API call (withinÂ `useEffect`) to themoviedb.org to fetch details about a single movie, then puts the response into state usingÂ `useState`Â and finally renders it onto the page.

The third component NotFound has a route that redirects the user from a 404 to a custom page. From here the user can get back to the homepage - I use Link to take the user back.


## Methods and Tools
- Route, Link and Redirect from react and react-router-dom
- useParams, useState and useEffect
- fetch()

## With a little help from my friends...
As always, I have expanded my knowledge with the help of the team, Stackoverflow, Google and our code coaches.

## Next step
As a next step, I would like to build larger sites with more pages and more interactivity.
