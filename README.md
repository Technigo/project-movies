# Project Movies

Mission was to focus on how to make react apps with multiple pages using routes. 


## The problem

I started off by writing with paper and pen, all parts and how they should work together, based on the brief. Installed all dependencies for our project and then I started to code in VS Code, and used Chrome inspector to see the result. 

I added a little responsive design and decided to remove the "back button" from the mobile view.
If I had more time I would like to do the stretch goals, like adding data from more lists.
