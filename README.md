# Project Movies

In this project we used React Routers for the first time and we did also deep dive in using API:S.

## The problem

Since we had difficulties to find time when both of us had time to work on the project, we divided the components and made one each. It was a practice in how to communicate remote while working together. I would say that it was a nice and successful team effort!
