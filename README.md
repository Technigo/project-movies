# Project Movies

The homepage for this website shows movie posters for today's trending movies according to The Movie Database. When you click on any poster, you will go to a page that has details specifically for that movie.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

This week, we worked in a small group to learn and practice using React Router to build more than one page for the website. We learned several new hooks, including useNavigate and useParams.  We also learned how to incorporate a .env file to store environmental variables. To start this project, we sketched our components and their relationships with pencil and paper. We then began coding each component so that we knew we could fetch the correct data from each API we needed to use. Once the pages were functional, we then split up into two groups to style each page component. We then merged our branches and tidied up the code. 

We have experimented with the .env file and and environmental variable in order to not include our API key directly in the code.  If we had more time, we would further test this to make sure it's working correctly (it still seems to show some errors).  If we had more time, we would also have done a bit more styling, and tried to incorporate additional APIs with different movie data.
