# Project Movies

This is a website built in React and React Router that shows the most popular movies right now and when clicked it shows the details of the movie. 

## The problem

I started by creating a list with the movies from the API. The different pages are linked using React Router. 
Then a second page was created containing the details of the movie generated from another API endpoint. There is a back button that leads you back to all the movies. 
If I had had more time I would have made an error message and added a page to see movies in the same genre.
