# Project 12 - Build a multi-page React application

In this week's project at Technigo Bootcamp 2019 we built our first multi-page React application. The goal for this week was to use an API to fetch multiple list of movies, display them on a page and then link to a movie detail page when you click on the movie.
You can also click on the actor and you will see all movies that actor have been in.
