# Project Movies

Building a multi-age React application using an api. Done pair programming by Amanda Tilly & Naushin Malik.

## The problem

The main goal was to create a multi page application by loading dynamic content. We used pre-defined components to route between pages and used the useParam hook to get the id from the url and then passed it into an api call to fetch the details and then rendering it to the page.
