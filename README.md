# Project Movies 🍿

The goal for this week was to create a multipage React application using React router and themoviedb.org's API to fetch a list of popular movies, display them on a page, and then link to a detail page for each movie when you click on them.

## Solving the assignment / What I've learned 🦉

In this project I've learned about React router and how to create multipage applications in React. I've also gained a deeper understanding of the useState and useEffect hooks. 

- I started out with planning and structuring the content of my project into components for the list of movies and the movie details (components MovieList and MovieThumb).
