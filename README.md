# Project Movies

Through pair-programming (@svempolin & @louise-becker) this project was to build a multi-page application using React Router showing the most popular movies in the US with data from an open API.

## The problem

In this project we got to use React.js, HTML, CSS, JSX and React components, API s in React - combining useState with useEffect. We also passed information such as movie titles in the url and picked this up in React router to load dynamic content.
For functionality we followed a step by step lecture, and for the design we looked at an existing page and mimicked that one. 
We started the project by making sure we could catch the correct data needed from the API. Then we went on with adding functionality with the help of React router, we also made a redirect when there was an error in the url request. Then we added styling to our page, for mobile and desktop.
If we had more time we would maybe experiment more with styling of the page in mobile.
