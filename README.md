# Project Movies

This weeks project is a pair-programming-project in collaboration with Sandra Olsson and Ylva Karlsson from Team Elephants of Technigos Web Dev Boot Camp Spring 2023.

The project is to use themoviedb.org's API to fetch a list of movies, display them on a page, and then link to a movie detail page when you click on the movie cover image.

## The problem

We used the TMDB:s API to fetch information about the movies and build this application using React. On Monday 27th of March we started this week off with planning the project in a simple Trello-board, we've signed up for the TMDB and got access to our API-key for this project. 

Our goal for the week was to pair-programme as much as we can and in the end of the week we will edit this readme with more information.
If we had more time for this, we would add more pages and fetch more information from other endpoints in the API. And continue to improve the overall design.
