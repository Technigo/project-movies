# Project Movies

A project done in React Router, using a movie database API to display information about recent movie releases. A collaboration between Vera Sjunnesson och Sofia Gerdmar.

## The problem

We started out putting up the groundwork of the sites with mob-programming, making sure the fetches worked as intended. Early on we had problems with getting one of the fetches to work, but after help on StackOverflow we managed to get it up and running. We then divided up, Vera working with elaborating the fetches and Sofia starting on the styling. When we had all the data we wanted to display, we both continued with the styling of the different sites.
