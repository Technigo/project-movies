# Project Movies

This week's project was to fetch movie details from The Movie DB and make a movie list. We should also make a page for each movie with details and render images from the api.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

We used styled components, React Icons and React Router DOM.
