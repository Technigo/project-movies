## What I have learned here 🧠

* How to use React router to create multi-page applications
* How to use placeholders in urls to pick dynamic parts from urls
* Practice using APIs in React - combining `useState` with `useEffect`

## Stretch Goals 🏃‍♂
I have implemented following things:

**_Movie not found_**

**_Loading states_**

**_More pages_**

**_Diffrent lists_**
