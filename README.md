# Project Movies

This project's focus was to make a movie app with multiple pages using React routes. 

## The problem

Technologies used: 
* themoviedb.org API
* React router

For Future Improvements
* Add sorting function for different movie ratings, genres etc
* Add search bar for movie titles

On this week's project we were tasked to display movie details from the API stated above. We used useEffect hook and fetch function to achieve this. We were also tasked to catch errors when the link is broken.
