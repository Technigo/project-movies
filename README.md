# Project Movies

This is a Moviesite created in React using an API from The MovieDB. The first page displays popular movies using the popular endpoint from the API. You can then navigate to two other lists called 'Top Rated' and 'Upcoming'.

When choosing one of the movie-cards you get sent to a more detailed page about the movie itself.

## The problem

In this project I practiced using React router to create this multipage application. I also practiced useState and useEffect in my application. This is the first project that I've practiced using the useParams hook to use placeholders in urls, making it possible to pick dynamic parts from urls.

**ðŸ”µ  Blue Level (Minimum Requirements)**
- The app should have at least two pages - one showing a list of movies and one showing details
- The design should mimic the Technigo example 

**ðŸ”´  Red Level (Intermediary Goals)**

- The site shows a 'not found' page if the user try to visit a movie detail page with an invalid movie ID.

**âš«  Black Level (Advanced Goals)**

- On the homepage where you list popular movies, you could add a dropdown to change the list. For example, you could toggle between popular, upcoming, and new releases.
(Here I used links instead to change the URL)
