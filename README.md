# Horror Movies Site

A multipage React application, that uses the moviedb API to present the most recent releases in the horror genre.

## Features

- Use of hooks: useEffect, useState, useHistory and useParams
- One page contains a movie list and the other the details of the selected movie
- Responsive styling
- Use of the React-icon library
- Error page & loading page
- Pair-programming

## The problem

- Styling in React has new challenges such as the multiple components and how they interact with each other. Additional testing was needed to make sure the styling were not affecting other components.

- Since the project was made in pair-programming, it was a great opportunity to practice merging new branches and solving conflicts.

- The useParams was a new concept and we learned the best use and placement for it.
