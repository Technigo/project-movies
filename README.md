# Project Movies

This is a multi-page react application that fetch data from themoviedb.org API and presents movie lists in various categories. When clicking on a movie the user is sent to a details page. If the user enters an incorrect address, a 404 page will is displayed.

## The problem

I started with creating the Routes and made sure that the links to the different pages worked as expected before I started with the styling.
This week, the styling was the most difficult, it was a real challenge to get the content to end up where it supposed to.

When most of the styling was done I created buttons in the header to be able to change the movie category.
