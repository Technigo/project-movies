# Project Movies

This was a project I did when attending Technigos 24 week frontend bootcamp. The assignment was to build  a multi-page React application, and using a API to fill it with content.

## The problem

This was the first time I was introduced to React Router and it was quite tricky getting the site to work. But with good help from the teatchers codealongs and support from my team, I finally got all the pieces together.

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
