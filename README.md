# Project Movies

Changing name to see

The main focus of this project was using routes in React.
We used APIs to fetch various movie and tv show collections to display on multiple pages with the help of useState, useEffect, Navigation Links and Routes.
This project was done in collaboration - by Nina Waldreus & Joanna Philips.

## The problem

First we sketched out the pages, components and the states we would need for each of them. 
Next we implemented each page connecting them through routes and navigation links. 
When faced with problems we turned for help to Stackoverflow, Google and other team members. 
Also used ChatGPT for support.
Improvements for the future would be to make the information richer by using more endpoints from the API.
