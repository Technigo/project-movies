# Project Movies

This site is about popular movies in the US.

## The problem

In this project I used HTML, CSS, JS, React, API, BEM and NPM. This is my first site with multi-page React. I used npm to instal some libraries that were needed for my project like loader and fontawesome. When I had problem I used google and stackoverflow. If I had more time I would done black level :)
