# Project Movies

This is week 12 assignment project of Technigo bootcamp. A multi-page application built using React Router, useState and useEffect.

## The problem

We have faced only one problem - when our project has been deployed on Netlify, the CSS hover effect was not working (it was working on the local server) and after entering the movie id that dit not exist, it was not redirecting to our "Page not found" page. These issues were fixed after removing the % in the opacity and adding a Status code if else statement in our fetch request.
