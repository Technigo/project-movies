# Project Movies

The aim of the project was to build a multi-page React application which fetches a list of movies using the themoviedb.org's API. 

## The problem

To solve the problem I used React router to create the multi-page application. I practiced using placeholders in urls to pick dynamic parts from urls and setting up the different fetch requests of the different pages. I also practiced on using APIs in React and combining 'useState' and 'useEffect'.
