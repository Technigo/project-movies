# Project Movies

This week's project was a pair programming with Mamite Andersson and myself. The project was to create a multi page React application with React router. The site displays the 20 most popular movies from Themoviedb.org's API

## The problem

Used features and work process:
-Hooks: useEffect,useState, and useParams.
-React route: one page contains the list of movies and the sub-page the details of the selected movie.
-Responsive styling, mobile first.
-Error page & loading page.
-Pair programming
