# Project Movies

This week we created our own movie site. We have build our first multi-page React application. We have also been pair programming.

## The problem

We started the week preparing, reading the instructions and planing for the assignment. We used stackoverflow,slack,google,notion and each other to solve our problems.

If we had more time we would make the page more advanced!
