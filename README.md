# Project Movies

Project fetching a popular movie API list with useEffect and present the movies on a page with dynamic react router adress.

## The problem

We started the project fetching a list from the API and presented it on the mainpage as a list component then hooked it up with react dynamic router address to add separate pages for each movie as a movie component. Everything went smooth at the beginning to end with no mayor problems except some small console log errors which we got lucky finding solutions online for.

If we had more time we would've wanted to maybe add a custom movie list or multiple lists, and maybe dig even deeper for information in the API.
