# Project Movies

This project was one of the projects at the Technigo bootcamp. The focus was to practice React Routing while using a movie API to fetch a list of movies, display them on a page and then link to a movie detail page when you click on the movie.

## The problem

I started out with the structure of the pages and routes before I added the styling. After that I also added another route to a page to see similar movies to the one you had clicked on. If there are no similar movies you are directed to a "not found-page".
