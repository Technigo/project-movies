# Project Movies

Project made week 12 of the Technigo Bootcamp. The aim was to make a movie site with more than one page using react router.

## The problem
This project was fun and pretty straight forward. I used fetch to get the movies from the api and mapped through them to get the details. This was the first time I worked with react-router and Links. Apart from a few hickups it went well.
