# Project Movies

This week we have build a movie app with React and using The Movie DB API to call different moive/tv-serie lists. 

## The problem

First we started to go thru the reading material, live and recorded session from Technigo. Our main focus this week was to build an app with browser routers / react routers in React. To start with our group project we had live sessions togther online but also pair programing in visual studio code to build the base of the project. When we had the base we divied the taks between us and worked in different branchens. In the end of the week we merge the branches and did the last fixes. 

Our challenge this week was our collection and sesason components when we were mapping inside an array in the API we got errors in the console. It took some time in the end to solve this but we got over the finish line. 

For finding answers and help we have used: 

- Google
