# Project Movies

This week we were to create a multi-page website using The Movie Database's API with multiple endpoints, React Router and various hooks.

## The problem

As with most projects I decided to dive straight in by building the initial fetch-function, and set up the different Routes. The part where I fetch the data from the API and build components using map-function feels rather safe now, so my main focus was to understand and to implement the navigation part. In some way I managed to get the functionality to work, but I wasn't all satisfied with my solution, so I decided to book a 1:1.

Afterwards I began working a lot with conditional rendering, and when the concept of using conditional statements to select what content to show became clear, it felt like the rest of the project was just a joyride.

Creating the buttons were especially fun, by working with Links, useHistory-hooks and connecting content with buttons. I also very much enjoyed figuring out how to redirect faulty requests to a 404-page, on all levels of the sitemap (/ and /movies).

If I had more time I would implement even more functions to show even more content. Just to repeat it all a bit more.
