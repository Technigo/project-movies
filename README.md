# Project Movies

- The project was about to build a movie site with react, react-router-dom and use params.

## The problem

- I made a plan before I started this work, which I usually do not do. 
  It made it easier to understand what I needed to do.

- If I had more time I would add one more side, and change the design. I followed the design example.

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
