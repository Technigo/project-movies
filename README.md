# Project Movies

Project-moves is to practice React router to create multi pages web app, at the same time, get used to useState and useEffect while fetching different API Endpoint

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?
React Router seems to be a straigthforward concept to graps. However, i have a bit difficulty while making sub pages in deeper level, especially with naming the route and connect pages with the right Link.

I am happy to play around with the API and creat a kind of complete ecosystem for the web with multi sub pages. The page is also responsive for mobile, table and desktop. I am glad to 
learn new tools like url_match, useParams.

To make the page perfect, I will need to apply useHistory, use default image for any movie-people that do not have image to print out.
