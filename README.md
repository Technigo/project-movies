# Project Movies

In this project I have created a page that shows a number of popular movies. I have created an additional page that shows details about a specific movie. 

## The problem

I used traditional pen and paper to plan the structure of the website. Number of pages, number of components etc. I used BrowserRouter, Switch, Route to make links between the two pages. If I had more time I would either do a filter function that filters out movies from a certain genre or I would make a button for showing more detailed information about the movies. 

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
