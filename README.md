# Project Movies

- Fetch movies and show on a listpage and show one page with details on each movie.

Really fun project! Enjoyed learning React Router and so fun to make a site with more than one page. The www suddenly opened up to something much more reachable. And 12 more weeks to go on the Bootcamp... 
 
## The problem

Always tricky part in pair projects to find the time to sit together, but I think that we managed quite well. If we hade more time we would for sure made a lot more. Learned more about the API and what we could have fetched from it. 

Got the loading page to work. Sort of... Content still shows when loading the detail page. Will have to go back and figure that out!
