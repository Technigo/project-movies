# Project Movies

This project was an introduction to route in React and how to create multipage web page with React routes. 


## The problem

I created the components and pages and needed and started with the movielist component and did the fetched the data for the most popular movies and displayed in a separate component called Movie. Then I created the page MovieDetails and fetched the data for the movie details for a specific movie and displayed the details of that movie in this page. I also did a redirect page in case the user searches something that doesn't exist. If I had more time I would have done a loader for the fetch. React links, routes, redirects, useState and useEffect were the tools used in this project.
