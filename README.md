# Project Movies

The goal for this week was to use themoviedb.org's API and React Router to fetch a list of movies, display them on a page, and then link to a movie detail page when you click on the movie. If the URL did not exist you should enter a 404 not found-page. This project was done in collaboration by [Camilla Cronqvist](https://github.com/camcron/) and Sammy Olsson.

## The problem

We planned the different components using mob-programming and divided the work between us.
We decided to work in different branches and then merge to one master branch.
