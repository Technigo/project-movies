# Project Movies
For this project we did a pair programming (partner: Tomoyo Alvåg). We practiced using React Router and fetching movies with API to render a page with a movie cards. When clicking on a card it should then render another page with details about the movie. This week we also tried a new way to style with styled components. 

## The problem

Our biggest problem was that the second fetch of another URL stayed undefined and would not give us data when console logging. We solved this problem by using the same URL we did when fetching for the list of movies. If we had more time we would try to style with styled components and making the website responsive.
