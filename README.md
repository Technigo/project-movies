# Project Movies
We needed to create a movie site whith React where we first display recent popular movie. 
If you click on a movie you get redirected to another page where you can read the details.

## The problem
First we checked the provided design and what was needed to be fetched. 
We discussed how to create the components while keeping the app.js file as clean as possible, as well as how to design it for different media sizes.
We have used React, APIs CSS Flexbox and Grid to create the page.
If we had more time we would like to create more pages and make it better for screen readers.
