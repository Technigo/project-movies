# Project Movies

- A multi-page React application based on the Movie Database API and primarily two lists made by me for this project.

## The problem

- If I had more time I would add a page "Movie not found".

## Learning objectives

- Using React router to create multi-page applications
- Using placeholders in urls to pick dynamic parts from urls
- Using APIs in React - combining useState with useEffect

## Tech

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JSX
- React
- React Router
