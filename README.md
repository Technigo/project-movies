# Project Movies

A website displaying movies based on different categories which you can choose from a drop-down menu. Each movie generated can be clicked on to reach a site where you can read more details about the movie.  

## The problem

The page is built with JavaScript and React Router. The movies are fetched from an API, and which API is controlled by the drop-down menu.
