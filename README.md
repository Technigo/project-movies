# Project Movies

Done in pair programming we build a multi-page movie site using React Router, API combined with useState and useEffect.

## The problem

We started out by planning what we needed on our first page and then the secound page. Then we did the project step by step starting with API fetches. When we approached a problem, we googled and looked at other solutions to help us get further in the project.

If we had more time, we would try to style the page using styled components.
