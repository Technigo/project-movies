## The problem

Had problems with the hover-effect and make it the right size, but google it and found a page at m3schools and solved the problem thanks to that! üòÑ
I made my own button with a hover-effect, was thinking about designing my own button in illustrator first but wanted to practice my design skills in code - which is not my best - but still 100% code!
