# Project Movies

This pair-programming project was to make a react app with multiple pages using routes.

✓  Pair-programming

✓ How to build multi-page applications using React Router.

✓ How to pass information such as product ids, or blog post titles in the URL and pick this up in React router to load dynamic content.

✓ Practice using APIs in React - combining `useState` with `useEffect`

## The problem

We layed out the foundation together planning what was to be done, then branched out making different components. Merging a couple of times then using pair programming getting the components mounted and working toghether. We managed to add a few stretch goals (back button, header and loader). If we had more time we would also add categorys to the header fetching them from the API.
