# Project Movies

This project was about building a multipage site in React, using the API from themoviedb.org

## The problem

I started by creating the landing page with a list of movie poster, and then added a detail-page, where you land when clicking one of the posters. I also added a "not found page".
The I built a header with navigation. The navigation takes the user to differen sites based on different search criterias (different endpoints in the API). What I'm planning to improve is to make the different search pages into one component, since they basically contain the same code, just different urls.
