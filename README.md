# Project Movies

This was a project I did while attending Technigos 24 week frontend bootcamp. The assignment was to build  a multi-page React application, and using a API to fill it with content.

## The problem

This was the first time I was introduced to React Router and it was quite tricky getting the site to work. But with good help from the teatchers codealongs and support from my team, I finally got all the pieces together.
