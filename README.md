Description:

Project where I used an api from themoviedb.org and created a multi page movie-site with categories where the user can choose If he wants to se top-rated movies, popular movies or upcoming movies. The app is also multipaged and displays ratings and information about each movie when selecting it.

What did I do?
First I used React router to create the multi-page applications. Then I went on to use placeholders in urls to pick dynamic parts from urls. I also used APIs in React - combining `useState` with `useEffect`. The last thing I did was styling the page using CSS and flexbox.

If I had more time I would of built an error 404 page if there would be an error. And also made the page responsive.
