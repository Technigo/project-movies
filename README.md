# Project Movies

This assignment was to create a website with react router to have one starter page with all movies and when you click on a movie you come to a more detailed page with information of that movie. Plus a 404 page with navigation back to the main site.

## The problem

We have done following this week:

-Using React Router
-Pair programming
-Styled components

We may want to stick to one of either if we want styled components or a css-sheet. But in this case we wanted to try the different approaches.
