A React project made through pair programming, practicing using API's, useEffect, useState and Navlinks
Made by Leo Thunell and Jennifer Feenestra-Areng√•rd

## The problem

There were not that many problems that could not be solved eventually but if there would have been more time, a hamburger-menu would have been implemented on mobile-view and making the "more info"-div to be able to be displayed on mobile device.
