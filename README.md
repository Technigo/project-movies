# Project Movies

A multipage application built with React using API fetching to display the popular movies.

## The problem

- One of the challenging part were to implement the useParams hook to create a dynamic id from API.

- Another challenge was to find a way to be able to merge our separate local versions when we had to work on the code spearately at different times. 

## Features

- Use of hooks: useEffect, useState, useHistory and useParams
- One page contains a movie list and the other the details of the selected movie
- Responsive styling
- Use of the React-icon library
- Error page & loading page
- Pair-programming
