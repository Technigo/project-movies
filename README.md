# Project Movies

A multi-page React application using the [Movie Database API] (https://www.themoviedb.org/).

## The problem

The app is divided in two pages using React Router, and each of them are split up in components. The movie listing page is rendered by combining `useState` and `useEffect`, via the filter input.
