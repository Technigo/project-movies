# Project Movies

Project of Jessica Hermansson and Aschwin Siaila

The project started good Jessica did a lot of the framework. Then we started to work together in VS-code we seperated the tasks and were able to merge the codes. The project was working with react-router and we were able to manage the requirements.

We had some challenges with the response of the API and also to catch the errors, but it took us not to long to figure this out. At the end we styled and cleaned up the code to finish the project.

Watcht the result in:
