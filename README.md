# Project Movies

This is a multi page React application using an open API from themoviedb to fetch information about movies. The app displays different movie lists depending on the users choice and also details about a selected movie. The user can also choose to see other movies from a selected production company.

## The problem

I had some difficulties getting the navigation menu to work using props and an onClick function to change the props, and also how to handle two functions inside one onClick.

## Learning objectives

- How to use useParams to pass parameters
- How to use Route and Redirect to create a multi page app and to redirect to an error page
- How to use useHistory to navigate inside the app
