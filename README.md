## 1. What is this?

The purpose of this project was to fetch movie data from themoviedb.org API and display them on a page and then link to a movie detail page when you'd click on the movie.
This project also introduce me to React router.
With this project I've learned:
* How to use React router to create multi-page applications
* How to use placeholders in urls to pick dynamic parts from urls
* Practice using APIs in React - combining useState with useEffect


## 2. What did I do?

For this project I've created different components for different pages. BrowserRouter was also used to navigate through all the movies according to their id. As stretch goal, I've also built the same for production companies. 
There is also in place a loader, based on a React state to create a better sense of browsing the page.
