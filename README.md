# Project Movies/TV-shows

The assignment was to use themoviedb.org's API to fetch a list of movies or TV-shows, display them on a page and link to a movie detail page when you click on the movie. The styling was impolemented from an example app using the same API.

## The problem

I started with analyzing the example app and the API documentation to find the building blocks I'd need for my components. Then I did a sketch of the flow of the app from the App.js to the pages and main components. A lot of time was speant trying to find out how to access props without having to send down each single one. The spread operator finally sorted out all the questions marks.
