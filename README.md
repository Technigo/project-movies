# Project Movies
Week 11 at Technigo Bootcamp
– Practicing React state skills by fetching and posting data to an API. 
– Learned about components life cycles
– Learned how to use the useEffect hook in React to perform actions when components mount, unmount, or when state changes.
– Learned how to call APIs from React and put the data into state.

## The problem

I solved this weeks project by fetching data in the pages that should show data and kept the App.js clean and easy to read.
