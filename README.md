# Project Movies

The pair-project was to create a movie site where you can brows thru different movies as well as check in the details of each movie.

## The problem

For this week we practiced on creating a mult-page application with using React Router, useState and useEffect. We fetched movies from an api and catched errors with a 404 page.
