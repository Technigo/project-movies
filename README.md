# Project Movies

We have created a multi-page site with react router. This site is showing an overview of the 20 top-rated movies. If you click on a movie you will be directed to a new page with the movie details.

## The problem

We started building up the infrastructure with a repetition from last week, creating hooks and state using useEffect and useState and fetched the data from APIs. Then we moved on to the using React Router to create paths between our two pages. Finally we styled the pages and made the site responsive.

If we had more time we would add an animation to our loading and maybe more animations to the site overall.
