# Project Movies

This assignment was to create a website with react router to have one starter page with all movies and when you click on a movie you come to a more detailed page with information of that movie. Plus a 404 page with navigation back to the main site.

## The problem

We have done following this week:

-Using React Router
-Pair programming
-Styled components

We may want to stick to one of either if we want styled components or a css-sheet. But in this case we wanted to try the different approaches.

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
