# Project Movies

The assignment was to make a page displaying popular movies in a list and when you clicked them it should take you to a page where you got some more info about that specific movie. To achieve that we had to fetch data from an api, get familiar with React Router and useParams, and also continue learning about the useState and useEffect hook.

## The problem

We were a group of three working on the project. We began by deciding what components we wanted to have and then we did all the routing in the App component. After that we moved on the List component and did the get request to the api and made sure that everything there was working. Once we got those things in place the first real challenge was to understand the useParams-thing that we used to make a get request for each specific movie once you clicked them. To actually get it to work was one thing, but wrapping your head around what was going on took some time.
We did almost everything together with mob-programming using LiveShare in VS Code and divided just a few styling things by the end of the project.
