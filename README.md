# Project Movies

In this pair-programming project, we have built a multi-page React Application using an API. 

## The problem

We fetched a list of movies from the themoviedb.org's API using a combination of useState and useEffect and displayed them on a page using CSS-grid. 

With React router, we linked each movie image to a movie detail page with additional information about the chosen movie. 

To pick dynamic parts from the URLs, we used react-placeholders.
