# Project Movies

This week we created our very own movies site. We built our first multi-page React application and used a new API. The project was done in pairs.
The app should have at least two pages - one showing a list of movies and one showing details about selected movie.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?
