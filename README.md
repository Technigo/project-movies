# Project Movies

This is a multi-page React application designed to showcase the use of APIs in React. The project utilizes useState and useEffect hooks to display information about upcoming movie releases. It was developed through pair programming.


## The problem

- working with an API and having it in an external folder 'utils' and then exporting it for the use of the project
- first time working with React Router
- using new React hooks
