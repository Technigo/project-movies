# Project Movies

This week we are making a website for popular movies (Ida and Simon )

## The problem

We started with planning the time for the project and made all the components and fetches with pair programming. The next step was to style it and working with loading and error fetches in one branch each. After merging we did the final styling in CSS. If we had more time we would have made a dropdown manu to toggle between popular, upcoming and new releases.
