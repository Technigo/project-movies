# Project Movies

https://mooovies.netlify.com/
Week 12 of Technigo's Bootcamp

My first multi-page React application, using a API from [themoviedb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org/). The assignment was to fetch a list of movies, display them on a page and then link to a movie detail page when clicking on the movie.

## Design

The design was supposed to follow the design which Technigo created, with one page showing a list of movies and one showing details.
