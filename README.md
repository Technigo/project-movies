# Project Movies
This weeks project was to build a multi-page site using React router.

## The problem
I started with coding along to Van's lecture on Monday, then I followed Damien's code along as well. I believe useEffect and useState is quite hard to understand and to be honest I really don't understand how to use them on my own yet. But I hopefully will during the upcoming weeks :)

What I've used:
- HTML
- React
- React router
- Javascript
