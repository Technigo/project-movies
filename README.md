# Project Movies

This week we built our first multi-page React application using a movie API. The project was done by pair programming and we chose to display top rated movies.

## The problem
We had a lot of issues displaying the API data and had to re-start our project twice before it all of a sudden started to work, we unfortunately do not know what the issue or solution was but this set us back quite a lot and cause quite a lot of headache.

If we had more time we would have spent more time on the CSS and the responsiveness.
