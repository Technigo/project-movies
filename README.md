# Project Movies

We created a multi-page movie site using React Router, useState, useEffect and useParams hooks. We added a navbar with a dropdown for sorting the movies, a loading spinner when fetching the movies, a first loading page and an error page. 

## The problem

We didn't encounter many problems, it went very well and we had a great teamwork. The few problems we had, we googled for help! We did the blue and red level and some of the black. So if we would have had more time we would have added more pages with more information about the movies.
