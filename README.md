# Project Movies[View Live!](https://suspicious-pike-e44788.netlify.app/)
In this week project, I have built my first multi-page React application, using a fun new API from themoviedb.org!

The goal was to use themoviedb.org's API to fetch a list of movies, in my case Popular movies, display them on a page, and then link to a movie detail page when you click on the movie.

To do this we have used React Router.

## The process and structure
I have reached the **RED LEVEL** ðŸ”´

TODO  

### Core Tech

* React Router
* useEffect Hook
* useState Hook
* useParams
* Fetch (GET)
* CSS3

If I had more time I would have wanted to present more information as for example genres on Movie Detail Page or add a dropdown to choose different categories to list (latest, now playing, top rated or upcoming).
