# Project Movies [View Live &#10555;](https://movies-lisa-sofia.netlify.app/)

In this project we have created an app to show popular movies and some information about each movie, fetching information from an API. We created the app through pair-programming.

## The problem

We stared the project by creating components for the movie-list and for the movie-details, and separate css-files for each component. To create a multi-page application we used React Router which is defined in App.js, we also passed information in the url to load dynamic content which can be picked up in React Router.

If we had more time the next steps for this project would be:
- Create a "not-found" page showing if the user has typed an invalid id.
- Loading states: what would show while the page is loading?
- Add a dropdown in the movie-list page for the user to toggle between popular, upcoming and new releases.
- Add links on the movie-list page to be able to see pages with more information related to the movie, for example the production company.
