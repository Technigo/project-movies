# Project Movies

A multipage application built with React using API fetching to display the popular movies.


## The problem

One of the challenging part were to implement the useParams hook to create a dynamic id from API.

Anoth Since the project was made in pair-programming, it was a great opportunity to practice merging new branches and solving conflicts.

- The useParams was a new concept and we learned the best use and placement for it.

## Features

- Use of hooks: useEffect, useState, useHistory and useParams
- One page contains a movie list and the other the details of the selected movie
- Responsive styling
- Use of the React-icon library
- Error page & loading page
- Pair-programming
