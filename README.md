# Project Movies

This was a week 12 pair-programming project @Technigo Frontend Bootcamp made by Camilla Ekman och Elsa Carlstr√∂m. In this project we were to create a webpage displaying a list of movies from a given API and when selecting a movie generate a second page with details about it.

## The problem

We used React Router to manage the multiple pages and error messages. We set up the fetch in App.js instead of in the MovieList.js to only fetch it once while the user switches between the routes. We did the styling according to the instruction and at the beginning collected in one CSS-file, but as we learned more about styled components throughout the week we decided to go for that instead and moved it to the separate components.

When we finished the basic requirements we decided to add a select to switch between different kinds of movie lists on the first page, a header and routes and functions to catch and display errors in the url. We also learned how to use media queries in styled components and added that as well.
