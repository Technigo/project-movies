# Project Movies

This project is a multi-page React application which uses API to fetch list of movies. The API provider is themoviedb.org and there are two fetches: 1) The list of movies 2) details of the selected movie. UseState and useEffect hooks are used to handle the API data.

Furthermore, the multi-page app is created using React router.
