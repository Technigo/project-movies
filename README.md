# Project Movies
The assignment was to produce a movie site showing popular movies, using react and react- routers, as well as APIs fetches. We choose not to use style components in this project, look forward to doing it in the next. 

## The problem
We started by sorting out the different components, decided o keep the app fairly “clean”. And focused large part of the coding to the components
We learnt to use the URL component for our APIs and how to solve the 404/undefined problems in consol by creating an “ApiImageAdress”. 
If we had more time we would create more features, for us the styling took more time than expected
