# Project Movies
How to build multi-page applications using React Router. 

How to pass information such as product ids, or blog post titles in the URL and pick this up in React router to load dynamic content.

Practice using APIs in React - combining useState with useEffect

## The problem
Sketching out design, started with first components and fetch API to populate first page with movies. Then linking each movie item to movie details page and added API to that. Finally styling and also making it responsive.

Would be cool to add more pages with other categories of movies. Like popular.
