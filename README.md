# Project Movies
This is a project where I have build a multi-page React application, with data from an API

## The problem

This project was very fun, and it was nice to build a multi-page application. In this project I've fetched data from the Movie data base API and map:ed through the list to print and collect info about every movie in the array. Then I made another fetch for the single movie component to get more info about every specific movie. I have included a loading spinner while the user is waiting for the data to fetch. When the user is on the single movies page I've made a button that shows up, that takes the user back to the movie list if wanted. I have also created a page that will catch the user if the user tries to enter a webadress that doesn't exist, and I also put the "back to movie list"-button on that page. 

If I had more time on this project my next step would be to create one more page if the user wanted more information about the production companies behind every movie etc. 

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
