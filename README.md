# Project Movies

The task was to build our first multi-page React application. One page with the movies and one page with the details about a specifik movie. 
We worked in pairs and did everything together with vsCode-liveshare. The project went faster than expected but we maybe need to deep dive a bit more to fully understand "useParams" that was new to us.
