# Project 12 - Build a multi-page React application

Project week 12 @ Technigo Bootcamp 2019 was to build our first multi-page React application. The goal for this week was to use an API to fetch multiple list of movies, display them on a page and then link to a movie detail page when you click on the movie. 

This week we had an design to start from and then were free to be creative from there.
