# Project Movies

Build a movie-page displaying the 20 latest movie-releases.
First project using React routes.

## The problem

We started with making a structure over the different components and what was going to happen in each of them.
We fetched data from API's, using different React hooks such as useState, useNavigate, useParam etc. First week with styled components, we used 
it on the button.
When we ran into some problems the help-channel in Slack came to our rescue.
If we had more time me would have worked more with the details in the styling and tried some more styled components.
