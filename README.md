# Project Movies 

See site here: https://mrsucodesproject12movieproject.netlify.com/

In this project, I've built a multi-page React application, and used a fun new API too!

The goal was to use [themoviedb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org/)'s API to fetch a list of movies (more on _which movies_ further down), display them on a page and then link to a movie detail page when you click on the movie.

In this app, I used the API to fetch popular movies in the US.

## What I learned üß†

* How to use React router to create multi-page applications
* How to use placeholders in urls to pick dynamic parts from urls
* Practice using APIs in React - combining `useState` with `useEffect`

## Using the API ‚ö°Ô∏è 

I registered an account with [themoviedb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org/) and then registered for an API key in order to use the API.
