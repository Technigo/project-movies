# Project Movies

A multi-page React application with top rated movies. :movie_camera:

## :brain: Learning objectives
- build multi-page application using React Router
- use placeholders in URLs to pick dynamic parts from urls (useParams hook)
- practice using APIs in React - combining useState with useEffect

## :heavy_check_mark: Features
- fetching & displaying top rated movies from themoviedb.org API
- click on a movie card opens a detailed page for each movie
- implemented a Movie button which returns the user from the detailed page back to the initial movie list page

## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Future improvements
- show a "not found" page if the movie ID is invalid
- add a loading spinner/message until the API response comes back
- drop-down menu including popular, upcoming and new releases movies
 
## :robot: Tech used 
- HTML5
- CSS3
- React (useEffect, useState, useParams hooks)
- JSX

## :eyes: View it live
