# Project Movies

Users should be able to:
- view the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- see all movies in the first page
- be redirected to each movie they select to see the movie's details
- be redirected back to the page with all movies when clicking left arrow < (back)


## What we have learned:

- Styled components
- React Router V6
- Pair programming 

## The problem

It was tricky to decide how to go about and use the styled components. In hindsight, for projects of this scale, the styled components can be combined in to one .js file dedicated to styling or evening use the styled component within each component.
