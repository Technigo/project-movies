# Project Movies 

In this project I built my first multi-page React application using a fun new API!

The goal was to use [themoviedb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org/)'s API to fetch a list of movies (more on _which movies_ further down), display them on a page and then link to a movie detail page when you click on the movie.

This time, rather than following designs from a set of images, I was supposed to follow the design which was created in the example app using the same API:

## What I lerned 🧠

* How to use React router to create multi-page applications
* How to use placeholders in urls to pick dynamic parts from urls
* Practice using APIs in React - combining `useState` with `useEffect`

## How I got started 💪🏼

I forked the repo, cloned into my projects folder on my computer and open up VS Code.
In the terminal, I ran `cd code` to change into the code folder
I installed the dependencies needed for react by running `npm install`
I ran the react development server by running `npm start`

I registered an account with [themoviedb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org/) and then I registered for an API key in order to use the API. 

## Requirements 🧪

* Your app should have at least two pages - one showing a list of movies and one showing details
* You should follow the design from our example (but it's ok to change things - just try to make it look nice)

## If I had more time 🏃‍♂

I would have added a "movie not found" reply and more pages and a made a search field for specific movie genres.
