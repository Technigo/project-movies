Description:

Project where we used an api from themoviedb.org and created a multi page movie-site with categories.

What did I do?
First I used React router to create the multi-page applications. Then went on to use placeholders in urls to pick dynamic parts from urls. I also used APIs in React - combining `useState` with `useEffect`. The last thing I did was styling the page using CSS and flexbox.

If I had more time I would of built an error 404 page if there would be an error.
