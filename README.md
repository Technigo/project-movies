# Project Movies

Bootcamp project 12, to make a multi-page movie application using React route.

## The problem
- used React route to connect pages
- practiced fetching data from API with useState and useEffect hooks
- Introduction to useParams

If I had more time I would have added more pages with other filters and an error rederect.
