# Project Movies

This project is built within the Technigo frontend developer bootcamp. 

The objective was to practice React Router and create a multi-page application, how to use placeholders in urls to pick dynamic parts from urls, and practice using APIs in React, combining useState and use Effect.

## The problem

I tried to focus on the basics and build a structure that I could understand and feel comfortable with. There were a lot of things to keep track of and needed to spend some time on getting the design right. 

A part from React Router I used useState, useEffect and useParams.  If I had more time I would look more into the API and create more lists for different purposes. I would also look into how to make the site responsive.
