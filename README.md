# Project Movies

This project was to creating our very own movies site with focus on making react apps with multiple pages using routes.

## The problem

We have worked in pairs with pair programming. The first thing we did was to plan our project in Figma. We made a sketch of the structure that we would like to follow, the components that we needed and what each of them should contain.
We started doing App.js where we made all the routes and fetched data. In next step we created the two pages- MovieList that displays all the movies you can choose from, and MovieDetails that show all information about the movie that you choose to read more about from the MovieList. To the project we have added a loader and a error page. 
If we had more time we would like to add icons on the back button and rating.
