# Project Movies

In this week's project, I've built my first multi-page React application, and using a fun new API too!

## The problem

The goal for this week is to use themoviedb.org's API to fetch a list of movies (more on which movies further down), display them on a page, and then link to a movie detail page when you click on the movie.
