# Project Movies

This project is a site displaying most 20 popular Movies using a Movie database API. The site is mobile-first and has two "pages" the first "start" renders a grid of the movies and when a movie is clicked a "details" site is rendered with more details about that movie. React-router is used to route to the different components based on the Movie Id from the API. The back button on the details page is styled using "styled-components".

## The problem

The objective in this project was to use react-router and styled-components.
