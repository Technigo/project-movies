# Project Movies

The assignment this week was to create a movie app, with data from OpenMovieDB. The main focus was to learn how to use React router and to continue working with state and useeffect.

## The problem

I started out getting access to the data, and printing it out in the console. When I had my api-calls ready, i started out with routes, one at the time.
