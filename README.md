# Project Movies

Nina Berggren & Linnéa Wahlström collab. 

The assignment was to create a multipage application using React router. The first page list recently released popular movies, and the second page shows details of a chosen movie from that list. There was a list of requirements and a design to follow. 

## The problem

First we fetched data from a movie database API, once for the movie list and once for the specific movie details. We made components for main page, details page, 404-page, header and loading function. The styling were made in css-files for each of these components.

If we had more time we wanted to make more pages and use more data from the API in creative ways.

Teamwork-approach: We have entirely different work-schedules (morning/day vs. evening/night) and it was an challenge to solve. It worked out great and was a good experience to collaborate with someone with delayed communictaion. We mostly communicated in text form using a *.md-file logging progress from each working session. And also create a task list going forward in the project.
