# Project Movies

With React and fetching from a movie API this weeks assignment were to create a multi-page movie site with different fetches from different APIS as well as one page for the movie details. The key were to work with:

  - Fetch from API's in React
  - useEffect
  - useState
  - BrowserRouter, Switch and Route

## The problem

I think React is super fun and great to work with. This week my biggest challenge has been to understand the API I'm fetching from, how to navigate and find the right link and get the key to work. I have also have had some styling challenges as we got a set-style to try to adapt as good as we could. 

If I would have more time I'd defenitely add the "select" to scroll between different pages, I would also have invested some more time with styling my "loader" and "error" page, for now I just kept them plain.
