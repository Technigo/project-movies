# Project Movies ðŸŽ¨

I build multi-page React application using an API from [themoviedb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org/) to fetch a list of movies, display them on a page and then link to a movie detail page when user clicks on the movie.

User can go back from the movie details to the movie list by clicking back link.

To style an app I use grid, to learn the difference between grid and flexbox.

App is responsive.
