# Project Movie-App
For week 8 of the Technigo bootcamp we have built a multi-page applications using React Router.

# The Problem
We began creating the different components needed for the app and the we set up routes between them. We have been fetching data about popular movies from The Movie BD API and displayed this info in different pages. We have both been pair-programming and woking separately. If we had more time we would have added a functionality to toggle between different selections of movies.
