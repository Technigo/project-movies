# Project Movies

This projects core goal was about fetching data from an API and display them on a page using "Route" and "Router" so that user can click around the website to see a more detailed site of each movie. The project was realized in a pairprogramming setup.

## The problem

First off we decided on the structure of the project. We started with two compontents/pages (home, moviedetail) and one component (moviethumb) to keep the app.js file as short as possible. The data was fetched quickly and the structure was also set up quickly and without any bigger struggles. For the styling we worked on the project seperately. Beside having a some struggles with Flexbox on this project working on it separately ended up in a couple of extra hours, because some information went lost between handing over the code. With some bigger issues regarding Flexbox, we got help from our team during the weekly teamsession. Also at some point decided to build our component (moviethumb) back and include it into app.js, because we couln't make the flexbox work for the movielist on the mainpage. We will have a look at this during a 1:1 with a codecoach next week.
Technologies and methods used during this project: javascript, react, react-router-dom, css, flexbox, vs code liveshare, netlify, pairprogramming,
