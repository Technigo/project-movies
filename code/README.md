## Project Movies

A multipage site that shows the current most popular movies and a details page about the selected movie when clicked. Built in React with data from the TMDB API (https://www.themoviedb.org/)

#### The process and problems

The point was to use React Router to build a site with multiple pages. The detail pages about each movie is fetched dynamically using useEffect and useParams, to get the movie ID from the URL and be able to fetch the right data from the API.

We designed our own loading spinner as our little fun project inside the project. If we had more time, we would spend more time on responsiveness in a smaller device & of course make our loading spinner better!
