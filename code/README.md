## Project 11: Movie listing website.

This is a multi-page React application, using a movie database API.

## Focus

- Practicing useEffect and useState
- Learning the usage of Route, Link, useHistory etc.
- Building multipage apps with React and logic for Page not found etc.

## The process

- I visualized my website on paper and decided on the components and pages I was going to use.
- Built the components and pages
- Styled the listing and the Movie details page with CSS adding some hover effect.

## Challenges to solve

Add a Back to movies button and improve the Page not found logic.

## View it live
