I created a site that shows the most popular movies right now from a free API. You can hover every monie to se titel and release date. Click on the movie to get more detals!

By fetching all the data in a console.log i hand picked all the data shown on the site. 
When i had decide what data to use i startet the skiss on how to put everything togheter in differnt section/divs and were to put what type of content. I always start by showing everything and then hide and show by hover a object. 
In the detail view i have a go back funktion at top, hover and it will change, click to go back to main site. 
The text an image will change on both page depending on the size of the screen.

To see the site click on this link: https://laughing-davinci-84971d.netlify.com/movies/475557
Enjoy :)
