# Project Movies

This project goal was to create a multi page application using React Router. In addition we were able to pass information from the API to React to load dynamic content. 

# The problem

 The main project we faced this week was that the app didn't work because the routes weren't matching. We solved this problem by asking for help on the Slack Overflow.
